# Percentage Calculator: Calculate Increases, Decreases & More
Percentages are everywhere—from sales discounts to interest rates and test scores. A percentage calculator is a versatile tool that helps you solve three common types of problems: finding a percentage of a number, finding what percentage one number is of another, and calculating the percentage increase or decrease between two values.

## What is a Percentage?
A percentage is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. It is denoted using the percent sign, "%". For example, 45% represents 45 out of 100, or 0.45.

## How does the Percentage Calculator work?
Our calculator handles the math for you based on the mode you select:
1.  **Find Percentage**: You enter the percentage (X) and the total (Y). The calculator multiplies them.
2.  **Find What Percent**: You enter the part (X) and the total (Y). The calculator divides X by Y and multiplies by 100.
3.  **Percentage Change**: You enter an old value (X) and a new value (Y). The calculator finds the difference and divides by the old value.

## Formula
*   **X% of Y**: `(X / 100) * Y`
    *   *Example*: 20% of 50 = `(20/100) * 50 = 10`
*   **X is what % of Y**: `(X / Y) * 100`
    *   *Example*: 10 is what % of 50? `(10/50) * 100 = 20%`
*   **Percentage Change**: `((Y - X) / X) * 100`
    *   *Example*: From 50 to 75. `((75-50)/50) * 100 = 50% Increase`

## How to use the calculator
1.  Select the type of calculation you want to perform from the dropdown menu.
2.  Enter your numbers in the "X" and "Y" fields.
3.  Click "Calculate".
4.  Click "Show Steps" to see the formula used.

## Example Scenarios
*   **Shopping**: A $200 jacket is 30% off. Use "Find Percentage" to see you save $60.
*   **Grades**: You got 42 questions right out of 50. Use "What Percent" to see you got an 84%.
*   **Investing**: Your stock went from $100 to $150. Use "Percentage Change" to see a 50% gain.

## When should you use this calculator?
Use it whenever you need to compare quantities or understand proportions. It is essential for calculating tips, taxes, discounts, and profit margins.

*   <a href="#/math/gpa">GPA Calculator</a>

## FAQs
### Q1: How do I calculate a 20% tip?
Multiply the bill amount by 0.20. Or, just move the decimal point one place to the left (10%) and double it.

### Q2: Can a percentage be greater than 100%?
Yes. If a price doubles, it has increased by 100%. If it triples, it increases by 200%.

### Q3: What is the difference between percentage change and percentage points?
Percentage change is the ratio of change to the original value. Percentage points are the simple arithmetic difference between two percentages (e.g., moving from 4% to 5% interest is a 1 percentage point increase, but a 25% increase in the rate).

## Key Takeaways
*   Percentages relate a number to 100.
*   The three main calculations are: finding a part, finding the rate, and finding the change.
*   Percentage change is crucial for understanding financial growth or loss.

# Quadratic Equation Calculator: Solver & Roots Finder
A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of the second degree, usually written in the form `ax² + bx + c = 0`. These equations appear frequently in physics, engineering, and geometry (like calculating the trajectory of a thrown ball). Our calculator instantly finds the roots (x-intercepts), the vertex, and the discriminant.

## What is a Quadratic Equation?
It is an equation where the highest exponent of the variable (usually x) is 2. The graph of a quadratic equation is a curve called a parabola.
*   **a**: The quadratic coefficient (cannot be 0).
*   **b**: The linear coefficient.
*   **c**: The constant term.

## How does the Quadratic Calculator work?
The calculator uses the **Quadratic Formula** to solve for x. It calculates the discriminant first to determine if the roots are real or complex (imaginary).

## Formula
The solutions for x are given by:
`x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a`

*   **Discriminant (Δ)**: `b² - 4ac`
    *   If Δ > 0: Two distinct real roots.
    *   If Δ = 0: One real root (repeated).
    *   If Δ < 0: Two complex roots.

## How to use the calculator
1.  Identify the coefficients a, b, and c from your equation.
2.  Enter them into the respective fields.
3.  Click "Solve".
4.  Review the roots and the step-by-step calculation.

# Equation Solver: Find Roots & Solve for X
Solving equations is the foundation of algebra. Whether you are dealing with linear equations, polynomials, or complex functions, finding the value of 'x' that makes the equation true is the goal. Our numeric equation solver helps you find these roots quickly.

## What is an Equation Solver?
An equation solver is a computational tool that finds the input values (roots) for which a function equals zero. For example, solving `x^2 - 4 = 0` gives the roots `x = 2` and `x = -2`.

## How does the Equation Solver work?
Our tool uses numeric methods (like the Newton-Raphson method or Bisection method) to approximate the root.
1.  **Input**: You provide a function `f(x)`.
2.  **Iteration**: The algorithm guesses a value for x, checks the result, and refines the guess to get closer to zero.
3.  **Convergence**: It repeats this until the result is close enough to zero to be considered a solution.

## Formula
This tool doesn't use a single formula but rather an algorithm. However, for the **Derivative** feature included, it uses the difference quotient:
`f'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / 2h`
This approximates the slope of the curve at point x.

## How to use the calculator
1.  Enter your function in JavaScript format (e.g., `x*x - 4` for x²-4).
2.  Enter a starting point or the point where you want to find the derivative.
3.  Click "Calculate".

## Example Scenarios
*   **Calculus**: Checking the derivative of a function at a specific point.
*   **Algebra**: Finding the x-intercepts of a higher-degree polynomial that is hard to factor.

## When should you use this calculator?
Use this when you have a non-linear equation that doesn't fit standard formulas (like the quadratic formula) or when you need a quick numeric derivative without doing the calculus rules by hand.

# EMI Calculator: Plan Your Loan Repayments
Taking out a loan is a major financial commitment. Whether it's for a house, a car, or a personal emergency, knowing your monthly outflow is critical. An EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculator helps you determine exactly how much you need to pay each month to clear your debt on time.

## What is EMI?
EMI stands for **Equated Monthly Installment**. It is a fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. Equated means the amount remains the same every month. Each payment includes two components:
1.  **Principal**: The portion that reduces the loan balance.
2.  **Interest**: The cost of borrowing the money.

## How does the EMI Calculator work?
The calculator uses the standard amortization formula to spread the principal and interest evenly over the loan tenure.
*   **Input**: Loan Amount (P), Interest Rate (R), Tenure (N).
*   **Output**: Monthly EMI, Total Interest Payable, Total Payment (Principal + Interest).

## Formula
`E = P * r * (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)`

*   **E**: EMI
*   **P**: Principal Loan Amount
*   **r**: Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)
*   **n**: Loan Tenure in Months

## How to use the calculator
1.  Enter the total loan amount.
2.  Enter the annual interest rate (e.g., 8.5 for 8.5%).
3.  Enter the tenure in years.
4.  Click "Calculate".
5.  View the Amortization Table to see how your balance decreases over time.

## Example Scenarios
*   **Car Loan**: You borrow $20,000 at 5% for 5 years. The calculator shows you pay roughly $377/month.
*   **Home Loan**: You borrow $300,000 at 4% for 30 years. You can see how much interest you will pay over the life of the loan (often more than the loan amount itself!).

## When should you use this calculator?
Use it *before* you apply for a loan. It helps you decide how much you can afford to borrow. It's also useful for comparing offers from different banks.

*   <a href="#/math/percentage">Percentage Calculator</a>

## FAQs
### Q1: Does the EMI change over time?
No, for a fixed-rate loan, the EMI stays the same. However, the proportion of interest vs. principal changes. Early payments are mostly interest; later payments are mostly principal.

### Q2: Can I reduce my EMI?
Yes, by increasing the loan tenure (which increases total interest paid) or by making a larger down payment to reduce the principal.

### Q3: What is an amortization schedule?
It is a table detailing each periodic payment on an amortizing loan, showing the amount of principal and the amount of interest that comprise each payment.

## Key Takeaways
*   EMI is your fixed monthly loan cost.
*   Longer tenures lower your EMI but increase the total interest you pay.
*   Always check the amortization table to understand the true cost of borrowing.

# Mortgage Calculator: Estimate Your Housing Costs
Buying a home is likely the largest purchase you will ever make. A mortgage calculator goes beyond simple loan math to include the "hidden" costs of homeownership, such as property taxes and insurance, giving you a realistic picture of your monthly housing payment.

## What is a Mortgage?
A mortgage is a loan specifically used to purchase real estate. The property itself serves as collateral for the loan. Mortgages typically have long terms, most commonly 15 or 30 years.

## How does the Mortgage Calculator work?
It calculates the principal and interest (P&I) just like an EMI calculator but adds:
1.  **Property Tax**: Annual tax paid to the local government.
2.  **Homeowners Insurance**: Protects the home against damage.
3.  **PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)**: Often required if your down payment is less than 20%.

## Formula
`Total Monthly Payment = (Principal + Interest) + (Annual Tax / 12) + (Annual Insurance / 12)`

## How to use the calculator
1.  Enter the Home Price.
2.  Enter your Down Payment amount.
3.  Enter the Interest Rate and Loan Term.
4.  Enter estimated Annual Property Tax.
5.  Click "Calculate Payment".

## Example Scenarios
*   **First-Time Buyer**: You want to buy a $250,000 condo with 5% down. The calculator shows that PMI and taxes add $400 to your monthly bill on top of the loan payment.
*   **Refinancing**: You check if switching from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage saves you money in the long run.

## When should you use this calculator?
Use it when you are house hunting. Don't just look at the sticker price of the house; look at the monthly payment. A cheaper house with high property taxes might cost more per month than a slightly more expensive house with low taxes.

*   <a href="#/finance/emi">EMI Calculator</a>
*   <a href="#/finance/compound-interest">Compound Interest Calculator</a>
*   <a href="#/math/percentage">Percentage Calculator</a>

## FAQs
### Q1: What is a "down payment"?
It is the upfront cash you pay for the house. The rest is covered by the mortgage. A standard down payment is 20%, but many programs allow 3% or 3.5%.

### Q2: How can I avoid PMI?
Usually, you can avoid Private Mortgage Insurance by making a down payment of at least 20% of the home's purchase price.

### Q3: Do interest rates vary?
Yes, they change daily based on the economy and your personal credit score.

## Key Takeaways
*   Your mortgage payment is more than just the loan; remember PITI (Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance).
*   A larger down payment lowers your monthly cost and saves on interest.
*   Use this tool to set a realistic budget before talking to a realtor.

## What is Compound Interest?
Compound interest is "interest on interest." When you invest money, you earn interest. In the next period, you earn interest on your original principal *plus* the interest you already earned. Over long periods, this creates an exponential growth curve.

## How does the Compound Interest Calculator work?
It projects the future value of an investment based on:
1.  **Principal**: Starting amount.
2.  **Contributions**: Money added regularly (e.g., monthly).
3.  **Rate**: Annual return rate.
4.  **Time**: How long the money grows.

## Formula
`A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)`
*   **A**: Future Value
*   **P**: Principal
*   **r**: Annual Interest Rate (decimal)
*   **n**: Number of times interest compounds per year
*   **t**: Number of years

## How to use the calculator
1.  Enter your initial investment (Principal).
2.  Enter your monthly contribution.
3.  Enter the expected annual interest rate (e.g., 7% for stock market average).
4.  Enter the number of years.
5.  Click "Calculate" to see the chart.

## Example Scenarios
*   **Retirement**: You start saving $500/month at age 25. By age 65, at 7% interest, you could have over $1.2 million.
*   **Savings Goal**: You want to save $20,000 for a wedding in 3 years. The calculator tells you how much to save monthly to hit that goal.

## When should you use this calculator?
Use it for long-term financial planning. It is a powerful motivator to start saving early, as time is the most important factor in compounding.

## FAQs
### Q1: What is a realistic interest rate?
The US stock market (S&P 500) has historically returned about 7-10% per year on average after inflation. Savings accounts usually offer 0.5% to 4%.

### Q2: Does compounding frequency matter?
Yes. Daily compounding grows faster than annual compounding, though for long periods the difference is often small compared to the interest rate itself.

### Q3: What is the Rule of 72?
It's a shortcut: Divide 72 by your interest rate to see how many years it takes to double your money. (e.g., 72 / 8% = 9 years).

## Key Takeaways
*   Time is your best friend in investing. Start early.
*   Regular contributions (consistency) matter as much as the interest rate.
*   Compound interest can work against you in debt (like credit cards) but for you in investments.

# BMI Calculator: Check Your Body Mass Index
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used screening tool to categorize weight status. While it doesn't measure body fat directly, it provides a quick snapshot of whether an individual is underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese based on their height.

## What is BMI?
BMI is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. The formula is `kg/m²` where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m² is their height in meters squared.

## How does the BMI Calculator work?
1.  **Input**: You enter your weight and height.
2.  **Conversion**: If you use pounds and inches, the calculator converts them to metric units.
3.  **Calculation**: It divides weight by height squared.
4.  **Classification**: It compares the result to standard health categories.

## Formula
`BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m))^2`

*   **Categories**:
    *   Underweight: < 18.5
    *   Normal weight: 18.5 – 24.9
    *   Overweight: 25 – 29.9
    *   Obesity: 30 or greater

## How to use the calculator
1.  Enter your weight (select kg or lb).
2.  Enter your height (select cm or ft/in).
3.  Click "Calculate".
4.  Read your BMI score and category.

## Example Scenarios
*   **Health Check**: You want to know if you are in a healthy range before visiting a doctor.
*   **Fitness Goals**: You are tracking your weight loss journey and want to see your BMI drop from "Overweight" to "Normal".

## When should you use this calculator?
Use it as a general guideline for health. However, remember that BMI does not distinguish between muscle and fat. A bodybuilder might have a high BMI but low body fat.

## FAQs
### Q1: Is BMI accurate for everyone?
No. It is less accurate for athletes, elderly people, and pregnant women. It is a population-level tool, not a perfect individual diagnostic.

### Q2: What is a "healthy" BMI?
For most adults, a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered healthy.

### Q3: Why do doctors still use BMI?
It is a quick, non-invasive, and free way to screen for potential weight-related health risks like heart disease and diabetes.

## Key Takeaways
*   BMI is a ratio of weight to height.
*   It is a useful screening tool but not a definitive measure of health.
*   Always consult a doctor for a full health assessment.

# BMR & Calorie Calculator: Master Your Metabolism
Understanding your energy needs is the first step to controlling your weight. Whether you want to lose fat, build muscle, or maintain your physique, you need to know your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) and TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).

## What is BMR?
**Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)** is the number of calories your body burns while at rest. Even if you stayed in bed all day, your body needs energy to breathe, circulate blood, and repair cells. This accounts for about 60-70% of your total calorie burn.

## How does the BMR Calculator work?
We use the **Mifflin-St Jeor Equation**, considered one of the most accurate formulas.
1.  **Calculate BMR**: Based on age, gender, weight, and height.
2.  **Apply Activity Factor**: Multiplies BMR by an activity level (sedentary to active) to find TDEE.

## Formula (Mifflin-St Jeor)
*   **Men**: `(10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5`
*   **Women**: `(10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161`

## How to use the calculator
1.  Enter your gender, age, height, and weight.
2.  Select your activity level (e.g., Sedentary, Lightly Active).
3.  Click "Calculate".
4.  The result shows your maintenance calories. To lose weight, subtract 500. To gain, add 500.

## Example Scenarios
*   **Weight Loss**: You find your maintenance is 2,200 calories. You start eating 1,700 calories a day to lose about 1 lb per week.
*   **Bulking**: You want to build muscle, so you eat slightly above your TDEE to fuel workouts.

## When should you use this calculator?
Use it whenever your weight changes significantly or your activity level changes. Recalculating every few months ensures your diet plan remains accurate.

## FAQs
### Q1: How many calories should I eat to lose weight?
A safe deficit is usually 500 calories below your TDEE, leading to about 1 lb of weight loss per week.

### Q2: Does muscle affect BMR?
Yes. Muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue. Increasing muscle mass raises your BMR.

### Q3: Why is the calculator result different from my fitness watch?
All calculators are estimates. Fitness watches use heart rate data which can be more dynamic, but even they have margins of error. Use the number as a starting point and adjust based on your real-world results.

## Key Takeaways
*   BMR is what you burn at rest; TDEE is what you burn in total.
*   Weight management is fundamentally about Calories In vs. Calories Out.
*   Use this tool to set a baseline for your nutrition plan.
