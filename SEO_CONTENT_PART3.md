# Calorie Calculator: How Much Should You Eat?
Calories are the fuel for your body. Whether you want to lose weight, gain muscle, or just stay healthy, knowing your daily calorie needs is essential. This calculator helps you find your "maintenance level" and sets targets for your goals.

## What is a Calorie?
A calorie is a unit of energy. In nutrition, we actually refer to "kilocalories" (kcal), but everyone just calls them calories. It measures how much energy food provides to the body.

## How does the Calorie Calculator work?
It uses your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) and TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) to estimate your needs.
1.  **BMR**: Calories burned at rest.
2.  **Activity**: Calories burned through movement.
3.  **Goal**: Adjusts the total for weight loss (-500) or gain (+500).

## Formula
`TDEE = BMR * Activity Multiplier`
*   Sedentary: 1.2
*   Lightly Active: 1.375
*   Moderately Active: 1.55
*   Very Active: 1.725

## How to use the calculator
1.  Enter your age, gender, height, and weight.
2.  Select your activity level honestly.
3.  Click "Calculate".
4.  Choose your goal (Maintain, Lose, Gain).

## Example Scenarios
*   **Summer Body**: You want to lose 10 lbs in 10 weeks. You need a daily deficit of 500 calories.
*   **Marathon Training**: You are running 30 miles a week. You need to eat *more* to prevent muscle loss.

## When should you use this calculator?
Use it as a starting point for any diet plan. Track your weight for 2 weeks; if it doesn't move, adjust your calories down or up.

## FAQs
### Q1: Are all calories equal?
For weight loss, yes (thermodynamics). For health, no. 100 calories of candy affects your insulin differently than 100 calories of broccoli.

### Q2: How low can I go?
It is generally not recommended for men to eat below 1500 or women below 1200 calories without medical supervision.

### Q3: Should I count exercise calories?
Be careful. Fitness trackers often overestimate burn. It's safer to not eat back your exercise calories if weight loss is the goal.

## Key Takeaways
*   Calories In vs. Calories Out determines weight.
*   Activity level plays a huge role in your daily needs.
*   Consistency is key.

# Pregnancy Due Date Calculator: When Will Baby Arrive?
Congratulations! Discovering you are pregnant is an exciting moment. One of the first questions everyone asks is: "When is the due date?" Our calculator gives you an estimated date of delivery (EDD) so you can start planning.

## What is a Due Date?
The estimated due date is 40 weeks from the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP). Only about 4% of babies are born on their exact due date, but it gives a timeframe for the arrival.

## How does the Due Date Calculator work?
It uses Naegele's Rule, the standard medical formula.
1.  Take the first day of the Last Menstrual Period (LMP).
2.  Add 7 days.
3.  Subtract 3 months.
4.  Add 1 year.

## Formula
`EDD = LMP + 280 days` (40 weeks)

## How to use the calculator
1.  Select the first day of your last period from the calendar.
2.  Adjust for cycle length if it's not 28 days.
3.  Click "Calculate".

## Example Scenarios
*   **Planning**: You need to know when to schedule maternity leave.
*   **Nursery Prep**: You want to have the crib ready by month 8.

## When should you use this calculator?
Use it as soon as you get a positive pregnancy test. Confirm the date later with an ultrasound from your doctor.

*   <a href="#/health/bmi">BMI Calculator</a>
*   <a href="#/health/calorie">Calorie Calculator</a>
*   <a href="#/general">General Calculators Hub</a>

## FAQs
### Q1: Is the due date accurate?
It is an estimate. Most babies are born between 38 and 42 weeks.

### Q2: What if I don't know my LMP?
A doctor can estimate the due date using an ultrasound to measure the baby's size.

### Q3: How are weeks counted?
Pregnancy is counted from the LMP, so you are technically "2 weeks pregnant" when conception happens!

## Key Takeaways
*   Pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks.
*   The due date is an estimate, not a deadline.
*   Ultrasounds provide the most accurate dating.

# Calorie Deficit Guide: The Science of Weight Loss
You've heard it a million times: "Eat less, move more." But what does that actually mean? A calorie deficit is the fundamental scientific requirement for losing fat. This guide explains how to create and maintain a healthy deficit.

## What is a Calorie Deficit?
A calorie deficit occurs when you burn more calories than you consume. When your body needs energy and doesn't get it from food, it taps into its stored energy (fat).

## How does it work?
1.  **Calculate TDEE**: Know how much you burn (Maintenance).
2.  **Reduce Intake**: Eat fewer calories than maintenance.
3.  **Increase Output**: Burn more calories through exercise.
4.  **Fat Loss**: The body metabolizes fat to make up the difference.

## Formula
`Deficit = Calories Out - Calories In`
*   3,500 calorie deficit ≈ 1 lb of fat loss.

## How to use the calculator (Calorie Tool)
Use our <a href="#/health/calorie">Calorie Calculator</a> to find your number. Aim for a deficit of 300-500 calories per day.

## Example Scenarios
*   **Diet Only**: You burn 2000. You eat 1500. Deficit = 500. Loss = 1 lb/week.
*   **Exercise**: You burn 2000. You run (burn 300). Total burn 2300. You eat 2000. Deficit = 300. Loss = 0.6 lb/week.

## When should you use a deficit?
Use a deficit only when you have body fat to lose. Do not run a deficit if you are underweight, pregnant, or a growing child.

## FAQs
### Q1: Can I lose weight without exercise?
Yes. Diet is the biggest factor in a calorie deficit. You can't out-run a bad diet.

### Q2: Will I lose muscle?
If the deficit is too large or protein intake is low, yes. Eat high protein and lift weights to preserve muscle.

### Q3: Why did my weight loss stop?
Your body adapts. As you lose weight, your BMR drops, so your maintenance level decreases. You need to recalculate your calories.

## Key Takeaways
*   No deficit = No weight loss.
*   Slow and steady (0.5 - 1% of body weight per week) is best.
*   Combine deficit with protein and resistance training for best results.
